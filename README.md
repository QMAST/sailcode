Sailcode
========

The current plan is to build an interface for every hardware device the
Arduino micro controllers are going to need to interface with.

A list of devices and current progress with each device can be found under the 
wiki page of this Github repository.

Most code, for interfacing with hardware should be placed in a Library, see
[this tutorial](http://arduino.cc/en/Hacking/LibraryTutorial) for information
about writing a library for Arduino.
